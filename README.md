# Conference-Demo app

This is a course project I did while following the Spring Framework path on Pluralsight.
This course is called Spring Framework: Creating your First Spring Boot Application and
it's made by Dan Bunker. This conference application, has speakers and sessions which
can be added into the database.

# Tools and Technologies used
I was introduced to Spring Boot, JPA, Hibernate. I created a Docker Container
which stored the PostgresSQL database instance inside. The application is also deployed to Heroku.

#Considerations
This application was made while learning Spring Boot,
however Dan Bunker does leave things we can add to the application.
So I will come back to update this once I have gained enough knowledge.
